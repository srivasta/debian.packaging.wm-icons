This directory contains some configuration files for the debian menu
system. These files should be edited to fit with your system and
copied to either /etc/menu-methods/ if you are root or to ~/.menu-methods/
as a simple user.

* wm-icons.h contains functions that you may used in any "menu method"
  script. You should edit/check the systemFindIcon function.

* wm-icons-data.h contains "data functions" used in wm-icons.h: a map from 
  the "standard sections" and wm-icons icons and a map from packages name
  to wm-icons icons.

* wm-icons-fvwm2rc-menu is a menu-method script for FVWM. You should edit
  the lines:
	rootprefix="/usr/local/share/fvwm/debian-menu-system/"
	userprefix="/.fvwm/debian-menu-system/"
  replace "/usr/local/share/fvwm/" by the FVWM configuration directory
  and ".fvwm" by the FVWM user directory. Then, you should add
	Read  debian-menu-system/wm-icons-menu
  in the configuration file and bind it in some ways e.g.:
  add:
	+ "menu system%menu/programs.xpm" Popup MenuFvwmDebianMenuSystem
  in your root menu 
  or add say:
	Mouse 1 R A Menu MenuFvwmDebianMenuSystem
  You should also use the configuration file "this dir"/../fvwm2rc

* Other window managers: just (copy and rename and) edit the correponding
  menu methods script; you should add "!include wm-icons.h" and then you
  can use the functions  wmIconsFindSectionIcon($section,$icon,"menu/")
  for the section icons and wmIconsFindIcon($section,$package,$icon,"menu/")
  for the application icons.

Good luck!
