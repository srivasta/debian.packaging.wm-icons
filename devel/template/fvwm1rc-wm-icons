#  This file includes fvwm1 configuration for using with wm-icons.
#  Optimized for the default fvwm-1.24r configuration.
#  Using this file doesn't break your existing .fvwmrc, just extends it.
#  You probably need to edit it if you have a non-default configuration.
#
#  Instructions:
#    1) Install wm-icons (configure & make install)
#    2) Prepend this file to your .fvwmrc. The Style lines must be appended.
#       There is no a simple way to include other files in fvwm1 without
#       a preprocessing. Am I wrong?
#    3) (Re)Start fvwm
#
#  The file is not perfect, it'll be better in the next versions.
#  Send your comments to migo@homemail.com.
